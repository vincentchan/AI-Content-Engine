## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Collect Reference Material

Ask the user:
> "Please share your reference material (newsletters, scripts, notes, journal entries, or other content). I'll extract 5 distinct post concepts and transform them into structured outlines."

Accept any of the following:
- Newsletters or articles
- Video scripts or transcripts
- Personal notes or journal entries
- Raw ideas or brainstorms
- URLs to fetch and analyze

If the user provides a URL, use WebFetch to retrieve the content.

### Step 2: Deep Analysis

Thoroughly analyze the reference material to identify:

| Element | What to Extract |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Core Themes** | Central topics and transformational insights |
| **Counterintuitive Truths** | Paradoxes and unexpected wisdom |
| **Core Problems** | Pain points the audience experiences |
| **Aspirational Archetypes** | Who the reader wants to become |
| **Reader Objections** | Resistance points and doubts |
| **Key Insights** | Wisdom and revelations |
| **Potential Metaphors** | Powerful imagery and narratives |
| **Universal Principles** | Truths with emotional resonance |

### Step 3: Develop 5 Post Concepts

Create 5 distinct post concepts based on the analysis. For each concept, follow this development process:

1. **Choose a counterintuitive truth** from the reference material
2. **Frame it as an absolute principle** (no hedging or qualifiers)
3. **Come up with short and practical examples** that illustrate the truth
4. **Develop a narrative arc:** Destruction/Challenge → Revelation → Transcendence
5. **Craft a memorable closing insight** that ties everything together

### Step 4: Structure Each Outline

For each of the 5 post outlines, extract and organize:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Core Paradox** | The central counterintuitive truth or tension that creates interest |
| **Key Quotes** | Direct quotes from the reference material for the given outline |
| **Big Idea** | The transformational concept that forms the post's foundation |
| **Core Problems** | 2-3 short, tangible, relatable pain points in the archetype's personal life |
| **Aspirational Statement** | The what and why behind traits/skills to develop |
| **Key Examples** | 2-3 short, concrete illustrations that support the big idea |
| **Reader Objections** | 2-3 short, relevant, unique objections written as the reader would say them |
| **Transformation Arc** | How the narrative progresses from challenge to revelation to transcendence |
| **Actionable Steps** | Staccato-style steps that align with the transformation arc and aspirational statement |
| **Memorable Closing Insight** | A one-sentence insight that ties everything together |

### Step 5: Apply Language Techniques

Apply these specific language techniques throughout:

| Technique | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Second-person "you"** | Use consistently to directly address the reader |
| **Imperative verbs** | "Be," "Reset," "Let go," "Build," "Destroy" |
| **Visual metaphors** | Elemental forces (fire, water, chaos, light) |
| **Absolute language** | "everything," "impossible," "never," "always" |
| **No qualifiers** | Avoid hedges, uncertainty markers, "maybe," "might" |
| **Concrete timeframes** | "4-6 weeks," "6 months," "10 years" for authority |
| **Opposing pairs** | Highlight paradoxes through contrast |

### Step 6: Save Output

1. Generate timestamp in format: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss`
2. Save the complete output to `/content-ideas/ideas-{timestamp}.md`
3. Report to user: "✓ Post outlines saved to /content-ideas/ideas-{timestamp}.md"

## High-Engagement Elements

Focus on elements with high engagement potential:

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Provocative opening statements** | Stops the scroll, creates tension |
| **Counterintuitive wisdom** | Challenges assumptions, triggers curiosity |
| **Universal truths with personal application** | Relatable yet actionable |
| **Emotionally resonant metaphors** | Creates visceral connection |
| **Memorable closing insights** | Provides shareable takeaway |

### Structural Patterns to Extract

- Short, declarative statement possibilities
- Opportunities for parallel structure
- Places for imperative verbs
- Potential for absolute statements
- Visual metaphors involving elemental forces

## Knowledge Base: Example Phrasing

Study these examples to understand the target tone and style:

### Example 1: The Blank Slate

> The best way to 'get your spark back' is burning everything down. You have to reset your life. You have to reset your mind. You have to let go of everything you were, everything you had, every lie you told yourself. Then, something else can take their place. Only a few do it. They let go of years and decades, wins and failures, skills and pride-to go somewhere new. It's hard, but simple. You can restart any time you want. Any time you have the strength. There's no feeling like it. Beauty starts with a blank slate. And a blank slate starts with the fiery destruction of your entire existence. Eventually, that inferno turns from pain to warmth. You sit there for a while. Basking in it. Then, The Idea hits you. And you're never the same again.

### Example 2: The Paradox

> Be a paradox. Build one thing, but don't be one thing. Be an artist and a capitalist. Be a savage and saint. Treat business like a game. Treat fitness like meditation. Believe in God. Believe in yourself. War and art. Spirit and profit. Be an insatiable serial killer in work. Be a golden retriever in life. Do everything to the extreme. You should be easy to recognize, but impossible to label. You stand outside the boxes that the world is divided by. The paradox is where magic happens. You give the world something new, by becoming something new. It's a line, between two opposites, that most never touch. Chaos and simplicity. Genius and madness. Greatness doesn't come from sitting on that tightrope. It comes from sprinting on it.

### Example 3: The Isolation

> It takes 4-6 weeks of uncomfortable isolation to rediscover who you are. Vision is formed alone. You can't listen to friends. You can't listen to family. You can't listen to critics. What you're meant to do- is seen through your eyes only. Other eyes will filter them. To their dreams. To their desires. To their view of what's possible. Don't seek attention when you don't know yourself. That confusion is a gift. When you embrace it, everything changes. Your reality must break a few times before your path becomes clear.

## Constraints

| Constraint | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| **Outlines Only** | Generate outlines, not complete posts |
| **Depth Over Tactics** | Focus on emotional resonance over tactical advice |
| **Distinct Themes** | Each of the 5 outlines must have a distinct theme |
| **Quality Over Comprehensiveness** | Prioritize engagement potential |
| **Source Fidelity** | Don't add information not implied in the reference material |
| **Insufficient Content Handling** | If reference material lacks sufficient content, note this and extract what's possible |

## Output Format

You MUST save the output in this exact format:

## Error Handling

### No Input Provided
- If user provides no input, prompt them again with examples of acceptable reference material:
  - Newsletters or articles
  - Video scripts or transcripts
  - Personal notes or journal entries
  - Raw ideas or brainstorms
  - URLs to fetch and analyze

### URL Fetch Failure
- If a URL fails to fetch, inform the user and ask for alternative input
- Offer to proceed with any text/description they can provide directly

### Insufficient Content
- If reference material lacks sufficient depth for 5 distinct outlines:
  - Note the limitation to the user
  - Generate as many quality outlines as the material supports
  - Suggest what additional context might help

## Important Notes

- Generate outlines only, not complete posts—the user will develop these into full posts
- Each of the 5 outlines must have a distinct theme—avoid repetition
- Focus on depth and emotional resonance over tactical advice
- Prioritize quality and engagement potential over comprehensiveness
- Don't add information not implied in the reference material
- Apply language techniques consistently: second-person, imperatives, absolutes, no qualifiers
- The Core Paradox rephrasing should get progressively shorter and punchier
- Reader Objections should be written exactly as the reader would say them (first person)
- Actionable Steps should be staccato-style—short, punchy, imperative
