## Analysis

### Psychological Triggers Applied
- **Time-bound promises:** Used in titles 1, 3, 9, 11, 13, 17 ("2 hours," "one day," "6 hours")
- **Transformation language:** Used in titles 4, 15, 22, 28 ("changed forever," "fix that changes everything")
- **Exclusivity framing:** Used in titles 14, 18, 24, 27 ("what nobody teaches," "simpler than you think")
- **Status elevation:** Used in titles 2, 5, 12, 16 ("top creators," "million-dollar brand")

### Structural Formulas Used
- **Bold Statement + (Detail):** Titles 1, 2, 8, 11, 12, 15, 19
- **How To + Outcome + (Method):** Titles 4, 6, 7, 9, 14, 16, 18, 20
- **Time-Bound + (Focus):** Titles 3, 13, 17

### Notes
- Titles 21, 24, 28 leverage the Dan Koe name recognition for authority and social proof
- The "2-hour" timeframe appears frequently as it's the core promise of the content system
- AI efficiency angles are likely strong performers given current creator pain points around time management and AI adoption
- Titles emphasizing validation/testing (7, 14, 20) address the common fear of creating content that flops
- The 30/70 rule (title 12) is a specific, memorable framework that creates curiosity
- Consider A/B testing titles with vs. without parenthetical details to see which performs better for your audience
