### Named Authorities & Social Proof

- What notable companies or individuals have validated or used the product/methodology?
- Are there impressive metrics you can cite? (Be specific: exact numbers, timeframes, percentages)

### Specific Anecdotes & Quotes
- Do you have memorable quotes from the founder or key characters?
- Are there specific user stories or testimonials that illustrate impact?
- Is there a humanizing moment (impact beyond business) you can share?

### Reframing Opportunities
- What common concept can you redefine? (e.g., luck, overnight success, launch day)
- What's the contrarian insight that challenges conventional wisdom?
- How does this story change how readers should think about a familiar topic?

### Content Parameters

## Context Gathering Notes

**Tips for Better Answers:**
- **Be hyper-specific:** "23 seconds" is better than "under a minute." Numbers build credibility.
- **Include real names:** Named people and companies create borrowed authority.
- **Share the messy parts:** Failures and setbacks build trust and make success claims more believable.
- **Think in contrasts:** Pair small, intimate details with big outcomes for maximum impact.
- **Mine for quotes:** Direct quotes from founders make the story feel authentic and shareable.

**Why Each Section Matters:**
| Section | Why It's Critical |
|---------|-------------------|
| Origin Story | Creates emotional buy-in; the hook lives here |
| Credibility Markers | Builds trust from the first paragraph |
| Failures | Makes success claims believable; accelerates trust |
| Tactical Details | Delivers value that justifies reader's time investment |
| Breakthrough Cohort | Makes product-market fit concrete and replicable |
| Specific Numbers | Precision creates believability; vague claims don't land |

**Minimum Viable Context:**
At minimum, provide answers to questions **1, 3, 5, 11, and 13** to generate usable content:
- Who is the subject and what's the impressive outcome?
- Who is the audience and what do they struggle with?
- What failures humanize the story?
- Who was the breakthrough user group?

All other questions will significantly improve output quality, especially the tactical framework questions (12-14) which deliver the actionable value readers crave.
